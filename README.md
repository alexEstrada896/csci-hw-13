q3: incorrect swap count on selectionSort, every time the maxIndex is updated doesn't mean a swap always mean a swap will happen (-1)

3. (3 pts) Write a complete program in a cpp file that uses two identical arrays of 20
integers:
14, 87, 32, 56, 73, 45, 29, 90, 63, 11,
48, 25, 69, 34, 82, 57, 76, 21, 39, 68
It should call a function that uses the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort one of the arrays in
ascending order. The function should keep a count of the number of swaps it makes.
Your program then should call a function that uses the Selection Sort algorithm to sort
the other array. It should also keep a count of the number of swaps it makes.
Display these values (the number of swaps Bubble Sort made and the number of swaps
Selection Sort made) on the screen
